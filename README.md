# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)  

Problem: Not everyone in your company should have the same level of access to all data. Sensitive information, whether it's personal employee details or confidential company data, needs to be protected with role-based permissions.  

Solution: To address the data access problem, you should implement role-based access control (RBAC). This involves defining specific roles, either within individual applications or company-wide, and assigning access permissions based on those roles. RBAC concepts and software have been well-established for over two decades, making now the opportune time to put a suitable system in place.
